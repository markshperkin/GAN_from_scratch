# GANs from Scratch Using PyTorch and TensorFlow

## Overview

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch using both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks. GANs are a class of machine learning models that consist of two neural networks — a generator and a discriminator — which compete against each other in a zero-sum game framework. The generator aims to produce realistic synthetic data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data.
## Article Reference

This project was built with the guidance of the article [GANs from Scratch 1: A Deep Introduction, with Code in PyTorch and TensorFlow](https://medium.com/ai-society/gans-from-scratch-1-a-deep-introduction-with-code-in-pytorch-and-tensorflow-cb03cdcdba0f). The article provided a comprehensive introduction to the theory behind GANs, along with detailed code implementations using both PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Class Project

This project was developed as part of the Neural Network class under the instruction of [Professor Vignesh Narayanan](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/narayanan_vignesh.php) at the University of South Carolina.
